# Jansjo-hacked-lamp
An Ikea lamp based project aiming to improve focusing and relaxing time.

COMPONENTS:
Ikea Jansjo Lamp (x1)
Arduino Uno (x1)
IMU sensor MPU - 6050 (x1)
Bluetooth sensor HC - 05 (x1)
RGB LED ((common anod) x1)
LDR (x1)
220 Ω Resistors (x3)
1M Ω resistor (x2)
10k Ω resistors (x1)
AC - DC transformer (12V, 2mA) (x1)
Wires


HOW IT WORKS:
Touch the lamp head to switch it on.
Cover it to switch it off.
Bend it up to have a warm, relaxing light.
Bend the lamp toward your desk to have a cold, focusing light.
Shake the head to start/end the timer mode.

The timer mode will switch from focus mode to relax mode to improve your learning.
By default it is set to 4 minutes of focus mode and 1 minute of relax mode for showcasing purposes.
It could be re-set by the included app file or directly by the .ino sketch.


The .apk file allows you to connect to the lamp and set your timer.
The .aia file allows you to edit the app using MIT App Inventor (https://appinventor.mit.edu/).
